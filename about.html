                <h1>About Cozero</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Cozero: Measuring Your Daily Carbon Habits, One Day at a Time!</p>
                <p>Cozero is a <strong>beginner-friendly web application</strong> designed to help individuals like you track your daily carbon footprint and develop eco-conscious habits. We believe that while large-scale climate solutions are crucial, personal accountability plays a vital role in addressing climate change.</p>
                <div class="sdg-info">
                    <p>Our project is deeply inspired by <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action</strong>. We empower users to log daily activities such as transportation, food choices, and energy usage to estimate their carbon emissions, fostering a greater understanding of their environmental impact.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>In the Philippines, many individuals are often unaware of how their daily habits contribute to carbon emissions. There's a significant gap in tools that offer a simple, localized, and user-friendly way to track and reduce oneâ€™s carbon footprint.</p>
                <p>Cozero aims to bridge this gap by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helping you log and monitor your daily carbon emissions.</li>
                    <li>Increasing awareness of how everyday actions affect the environment.</li>
                    <li>Encouraging you to form sustainable habits through reminders and visual feedback.</li>
                    <li>Supporting SDG 13 by promoting climate action at the individual level.</li>
                </ul>
